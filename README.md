## Overview

The ConvTransformer model combines convolutional layers for local feature extraction and transformers for capturing global dependencies. This hybrid approach allows the model to effectively learn both local and global patterns in the input data, making it suitable for various classification tasks.

## Model Architecture

The ConvTransformer model consists of the following components:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: A series of 1D convolutional layers are used to extract local features from the input data. Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization, LeakyReLU activation, and average pooling.

2. **Positional Encoding**: Positional encoding is added to the input sequence to incorporate positional information into the transformer layers.

3. **Transformer Blocks**: The transformer blocks consist of multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to capture dependencies between different positions in the input sequence.

4. **Classification Head**: The output of the transformer blocks is averaged globally, and then passed through an MLP head for classification. The MLP head consists of linear layers with batch normalization, LeakyReLU activation, and dropout.

## Installation

To use the ConvTransformer model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/suhail7868/convtransformer-classification.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the ConvTransformer model:

```python
from convtransformer import ConvTransformerClassifier

# Instantiate the model
input_size = 16000
num_classes = 10
conv_channels = [32, 64, 128]
conv_kernel_sizes = [8, 5, 3]
conv_strides = [1, 1, 1]
embed_size = 128
num_heads = 4
num_transformer_blocks = 2
mlp_hidden_dim = 128
dropout = 0.1

model = ConvTransformerClassifier(input_size, num_classes, conv_channels, conv_kernel_sizes, conv_strides, embed_size, num_heads, num_transformer_blocks, mlp_hidden_dim, dropout)

# Prepare input data
input_tensor = torch.randn((32, 9, 16000))

# Forward pass
output = model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape)
```

## Results
